As for Structure Spider, I keep meaning to get good enough with it to do a tutorial. I'll make that my focus this weekend. Someone asked about it recently on the CE forum and DarkByte replied:

"if you have two objects, and want to compare them up to multiple levels deep, use the structure spider. There is also a string only option which can be useful as well."

Using the CE help file to elaborate on that a bit:

"The structure spider is like the structure dissect a useful tool in finding common values and differences between structures. The structure spider goes a bit further in that it automatically follows all possible pointer paths. When doing a scan, you can give two base pointers and tell the scanner that the values should be the same, or different.

Another use of the structure spider is that it can focus on stringscans, which is useful for heavily scripted games. For example, if a script engine changes the value of a variable named "ammo" you could do a structure scan for the text "ammo". This will show all paths to that variablename.
Do a rescan a few times to filter out the paths that are wrong, and you'll have a pretty stable pointerpath you can use in a code injection to see if the script engine is going to change ammo, or something else."

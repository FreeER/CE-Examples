Use a translation file and in there replace Cheat Engine with something else.

@DB just to clarify, i would need to..
1. Create \languages\se_SE (as if the new language i want to create is "SE" language, short for Something Else language)
2. Copy "cheatengine-x86_64.po" in there and add "Something Else" in "msgstr" so now they look like this >> msgstr "Something Else" <<
3. Run cheat engine with --LANG se_SE

hmmm that didnt work
i mean, i can change the context menu to whatever i want now but the process itself is still called "Cheat Engine"(edited)
unlike the HxD method

Execute the lua code getApplication().Title="Fuckwuck"  (place it in autorun)(edited)

that works
i also figured that if i change ""mainunit2.cename" and "tabout.groupbox1.caption"(edited)
and the result is the same as the fuckwuck method(edited)
but there is a problem

[FreeER summarizing:] with task manager in windows 10 still showing Cheat Engine for the main process, DB states that it works on windows 7 but 10 "remembers it". Still seemed to work for the AC bypass though

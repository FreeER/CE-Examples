Quick video on duplicating scan tabs in CE (useful to start with changed/unchanged and then change to increasing/decreasing without losing your work if you were wrong)

1. Do a scan
2. Open the folder %temp%\Cheat Engine (perferably sort by Date modified)
3. Copy the _contents_ of the newest folder
3. Switch back to CE and create a new tab
4. Do a scan (for anything, excluding long scans for something like 0/1 etc.)
5. Back in the temp folder open the newly created folder and paste the contents (overwrite)
6. Switch back to CE and change tabs and back again and you'll see the results

That's it! Hope you find it useful :)

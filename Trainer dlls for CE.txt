I made a trainer for a Unity game and it keeps asking for the Monocollector.DLL when it's inside the trainer already + in the same folder too + the Mono option enabled. Where should I place it then? It makes no sense

monodatacollector needs to be in the same relative path like in CE.  So autorun\dlls\MonoDataCollector.dll

How does one get the right-click menu of the search results list in Lua? I know how to get the actual results (getCurrentMemscan()), but not the control itself. I would like to add a menu item to the popup menu on that control.

@Abystus this seems to work, until you actually right click to try it out:

local flp = MainForm.foundlistpopup
for k=0,flp.Items.Count-1 do print(tostring(flp.Items[k].Caption)) end print('')

local mi = createMenuItem(flp)
mi.Caption = 'Test'
mi.OnClick = function(...)
  local arguments = {...}
  print(#arguments)
  for k,v in pairs(arguments) do
    print(k, tostring(v))
  end
end
flp.Items.add(mi)

for k=0,flp.Items.Count-1 do print(tostring(flp.Items[k].Caption)) end


I'm guessing the menu is recreated every time you right click but I haven't actually looked at the source yet.
well, using flp.Items.insert(0,mi) worked... strange.
@DB ^ bug?

Yeah you should be able to do that directly in the autorun folder
I'll try that later on thank you for the information
@FreeER I really appreciate the quick response on that one

no problem :smiley:
hm, inserting up to .Count-3 works. That happens to be about where the list would normally end without the two custom types I have, there also happen to be 3 separators but that seems less likely to be related imo
and yes, adding 2 custom types means I have to adjust it to .Count-5 for the test item to appear.

Just insert your menuitem BEFORE MainForm.miDisplayDouble.MenuIndex and you'll be fine
everything after that will get deleted on popup

and if you insist on having it at the end, hook MainForm.foundlistpopup.OnPopup and each time it's called add your menu item to the end

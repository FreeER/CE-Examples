request: Save the results of a dissected code in a file where we can load it up again
reason: some games being >30+ or more MB in total of pure processor code can take a really long time, for lower tier PCs this could take up to 30 minutes just for CE to Dissect the code. Once CE crashes or closes down, the dissected code will no longer exist. Making it a nuisence to Dissect the code again as the person have to wait for another 30 minutes(edited)

Extremely useful for packed games or games with a fixed address table

that sounds potentially useful, but I probably won't remember by the time I need it lol, so if anyone is interested here's an extension that essentially let's you do it from the GUI

oh, and if you don't want it in a "FreeER's Extensions" menu item you can change the local useGroupMenu = true line to false and just get a "Save Dissect Code" item instead, or if you want to change what menu it uses then change local extGroupMenuCaption = 'FreeER\'s Extensions' to use whatever name you like.
